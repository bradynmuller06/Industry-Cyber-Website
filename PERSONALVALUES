        <h2>Hard Working</h2>
        <p>
            Hard work is the foundation of progress and growth. To me, being hard working means 
            showing up every day ready to give consistent effort, even when motivation is low. 
            It’s about developing discipline, pushing through challenges, and staying committed 
            to both short-term goals and long-term dreams. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I value hard work because it builds character and teaches responsibility. 
            It also allows me to take pride in the results of my dedication, 
            knowing that nothing worthwhile comes without effort.
        </p>

        <h2>Adapting</h2>
        <p>
            Adapting means being flexible and open to change. Life rarely goes exactly 
            as planned, and the ability to adjust when unexpected things happen is 
            one of the most valuable skills to have. Whether it’s learning a new 
            skill, facing a sudden challenge, or working with new people, adapting 
            allows me to grow and move forward instead of being held back.
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe that adaptability shows resilience and creativity. It means 
            finding solutions instead of getting stuck on problems. By embracing 
            change rather than resisting it, I can discover new opportunities and 
            keep a positive outlook even in tough times.
        </p>

        <h2>Persevering</h2>
        <p>
            Perseverance is the ability to keep going despite obstacles, failures, 
            or setbacks. To me, it’s about refusing to quit when things get hard 
            and pushing through challenges with determination. Perseverance is not 
            about being perfect — it’s about showing courage and persistence even 
            when the path forward is unclear.
        </p>
        <p>
            I value perseverance because success is rarely immediate. Achievements 
            often come after many attempts, struggles, and lessons learned. Staying 
            determined in the face of difficulty proves that giving up is never an option, 
            and every step forward — no matter how small — matters.
